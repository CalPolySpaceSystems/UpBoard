# Cal Poly Space Systems Upboard

This repository contains the code that powers our custom rocket telemetry and control board, call the upboard.

Currently it's just board support code for the upboard, but will grow in the future.

Board support code inspired by [Runtimeco's Arduino Zero BSP](https://github.com/runtimeco/mynewt_arduino_zero)

Chip target is the SAM3x8e
